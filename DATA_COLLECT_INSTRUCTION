1. Compliation:
   Makefile is available in each benchmark with 3 rules: original, GPU offloading, OMP metadirective. (NOTE: some might not have all the implementations ready) 
   Example: BFS
     Original: make bfs
     GPU offloading: make bfs_offload
     metadirective (still WIP): make bfs_offload_meta    

2. Run Experiments
  1. Original on CPU:  run_variant.sh uses vtune to collect threading and hpc-performance related metrics. Output, profiled data and summary in text format, are written to ${APPName}-log directory.
  2. GPU ffloading: run_GPU_variats.sh uses nvproof to collect all available metrics.  Output, summary in csv file, is written to ${APPName}-log directory.

3. Data Processing
  1. GPU data processing: scrpts/extractGPUTrace.py
     Combined all measurements into a single CSV file with all the collectable metrics and events.
     example: cd bfs/bfs_offload-log; python3 ../../../scripts/extractGPUTrace.py
